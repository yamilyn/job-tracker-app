### üë©‚Äçüíª Tech stack
- The programming languages used in this project are [Python](https://www.python.org/), JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS.
- This project uses the [Django Project framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
    - To create our own modern forms instead of using the inbuilt from Django, we have used a dependency called [widget_tweaks](https://pypi.org/project/django-widget-tweaks/).
    - When a user `signup`, a profile is automatically created, then the user is able to upload and change their profile photo, for this we have used a dependency called [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/).
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/), a powerful open source object-relational database system that has earned a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- For the styling, the app uses the [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/) package which is a front-end framework based on Material Design.
- The app uses the font ["Oleo Script Swash Caps"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oleo+Script+Swash+Caps) as its logo font.

### üåü Development process
This was a team project (3 people) built in 4 days. My responsibility included building the model, views and templates (MVT design pattern) for the Jobs, also integrating with other many-to-many requirements, I also contributed to the front-end by adding styling, extra responsive features and fixing minor bugs.
<br>
<br>
As a team we decided to break complex tasks into smaller parts in order to manage our time. We also started each day with a sprint stand-up following the Agile project principles.

#### Tasks 
- MVT design pattern for Jobs
- MVT design pattern for requirements
- MVT for profile
- Authentication using Django contrib
- Front end scripts (JS, jQuery)
- Front end styling (HTML, CSS)

#### Communication with team
The app was built remotely and the communication happened through **Zoom**, **Slack**, **Trello**, **shared spreadsheet**.

### üíé My key learnings & challenges

The development was entirely remote and it is always a big experience for me and something that taught me just how flexible and resilient I can be.
<br>
<br>
My goal in this project was to identify best practices in order to have very productive days and successful remote working.
<br>
<br>
As a team, we quickly figure out how to start each day with a sprint stand-up and merging each other's codes in order to resolve any conflicts. We also had a shared worksheet to see and always remember the division of tasks.
<br>
<br>
On the day of the delivery (day 4), we were more organised and productive as we had already most features ready for deployment.
<br>
<br>
This only shows how much I could learn if I really throw myself into new challenges.
<br>
<br>
I started this project developing the `Job` data model and related features, here is a brief examples of my coding:

```jsx
class Job(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    company = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    contract_type = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    salary = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    link = models.URLField(max_length=2000)
    description = models.TextField(max_length=2000)
    contact = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    requirements = models.ManyToManyField(Requirements)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=100, choices=STATUS_CHOICES, default='New')
    feedback = models.TextField(max_length=250, default='', blank=True)

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('detail', kwargs = {'job_id': self.id})

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```
And `urls.py`:

```jsx
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
    path('jobs/', views.jobs_index, name='index'),
    path('jobs/<int:job_id>/', views.jobs_detail, name='detail'),
    path('jobs/create/', views.JobCreate.as_view(), name='jobs_create'),
    path('jobs/<int:pk>/update/', views.JobUpdate.as_view(), name='jobs_update'),
    path('jobs/<int:pk>/delete/', views.JobDelete.as_view(), name='jobs_delete'),
    path('jobs/<int:job_id>/add_requirement/', views.add_requirement, name='add_requirement'),
    path('jobs/<int:job_id>/edit_status/', views.edit_status_index, name='job_edit_status'),
]
```

I also integrated the many-to-many relationship between `Job` and `Requirement`. 

```jsx  
# M/M
    path('jobs/<int:job_id>/assoc_requirement/<int:requirement_id>/', views.assoc_requirement, name='assoc_requirement'),
    path('jobs/<int:job_id>/unassoc_requirement/<int:requirement_id>/', views.unassoc_requirement, name='unassoc_requirement'),
```
And creating the CRUD in `views.py`:

```jsx
class JobCreate(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):
    model = Job
    fields = ['title', 'company', 'contract_type', 'salary', 'link', 'description', 'contact']

    def form_valid(self, form):
        form.instance.user = self.request.user
        return super().form_valid(form)


class JobUpdate(LoginRequiredMixin, UpdateView):
    model = Job
    fields = ['title', 'company', 'contract_type', 'salary', 'link', 'description', 'contact']

    def form_valid(self, form):
        form.instance.user = self.request.user
        return super().form_valid(form)

# For the modal button on index
def edit_status_index(request, job_id):
    instance = get_object_or_404(Job, id=job_id)
    s_form = StatusForm(instance=instance) 
    if request.method == 'POST':
        s_form = StatusForm(request.POST, instance=instance)

        if s_form.is_valid():
            s_form.save(commit=True)
            # messages.success(request, f'Updated Successfully')

            return HttpResponse(s_form.as_table())
        else:
            print("Not updated, you can 'see details' and edit there")
    return HttpResponse(s_form.as_table())
    


class JobDelete(LoginRequiredMixin, DeleteView):
    model = Job
    success_url = '/jobs/'
```

![JobDetailPage](/img/job-detail-page.jpg)

***

### üí° Nice to have future enhancements:

- Use web scraping to find and pull jobs from job sites
- Add password reset by email
- Remove unsuccessful jobs from index page 
- Unsuccessful job status goes to a different page
- View all feedback from unsuccessful jobs in one place
- Change the colour of the emphasis line when filling out forms (using SASS)
- More styling.

***

### üêû Bugs

The `signup` page can still be accessed by logged in users, this should be redirected to the `job index page`.
Details on how to choose a password should be added in the `signup` page. The app only accepts ***6 characters long with one uppercase and one number***.
