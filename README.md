### üìù Description
A powerful Job Application Tracking App for both Junior Graduate and Senior Software Engineers. Now it's super easy to manage jobs, collect job application requirements right from the convenience of your browser. Job Tracker increases productivity, improves time sheet accuracy, and saves you an endless amount of time and effort. 

### üöÄ Deployment
See the working app [here](https://jobtrackersei64.herokuapp.com/)

### üåü Development process
This was a team project (3 people) built in 4 days. My responsibility included building the model, views and templates (MVT design pattern) for the Jobs, also integrating with other many-to-many requirements, I also contributed to the front-end by adding styling, extra responsive features and fixing minor bugs.
<br>
<br>
As a team we decided to break complex tasks into smaller parts in order to manage our time. We also started each day with a sprint stand-up following the Agile project principles.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Tech stack
- The programming languages in this project are [Python](https://www.python.org/), JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS.
- This project uses the [Django Project framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
    - To create our own modern forms instead of using the inbuilt from Django, we have used a dependency called [widget_tweaks](https://pypi.org/project/django-widget-tweaks/).
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/), a powerful open source object-relational database system that has earned a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- For the styling, the app uses the [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/) package which is a front-end framework based on Material Design.
- The app uses the font ["Oleo Script Swash Caps"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oleo+Script+Swash+Caps) as its logo font.
